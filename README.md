# Ai-lert

Ai-lert is a tool I’m building to help people report emergencies easily, especially in places where access to help is limited. Instead of having to call or wait endlessly, users can simply dial a USSD code, send a WhatsApp message, or use SMS to report their situation — and the system will handle it from there.

At its core, Ai-lert uses artificial intelligence to understand the message (even in local or informal language), categorize the emergency, and route it to the right responders. The goal is to save time, reduce confusion, and help more people get the help they need, faster.

## Why Ai-lert?

Many people, especially in remote areas or under-resourced communities, don’t have access to emergency numbers, smartphones, or even internet. They might not know who to contact or how to describe their situation. That’s a real problem — and one that could cost lives.

Ai-lert is my attempt to bridge that gap using tools that are already familiar and accessible: USSD, WhatsApp, and SMS. I want to remove the technical barrier and make reporting easier for everyone.
